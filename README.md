# Classic Baked Vanilla Cheesecake

## Ingredients

- 100g regular sugar
- 155g brown sugar
- 200g butter
- 300g flour
- 500g cream cheese (e.g., 'Philadelphia Original')
- 300g crème fraîche
- 4 eggs
- 3 tsp vanilla essence
- 1 pinch of salt

## Shortcrust Pastry Pt. 1

To prepare the shortcrust pastry, mix:

- 100g sugar
- 200g butter
- 300g flour
- 1 egg
- 1 pinch of salt

Then, put the mix into the fridge for 30-45 minutes.

Preheat your oven to 160°C.

## Shortcrust Pastry Pt. 2

Line the bottom of your cake tin with baking paper. Spread the shortcrust pastry evenly across the base and up the sides, about 5 cm high. Place the cake tin back in the fridge while you prepare the cheesecake filling.

## Cheesecake Filling

Mix the following ingredients:

- 500g cream cheese
- 300g crème fraîche
- 155g brown sugar (the original recipe uses caster sugar, but I find that too sweet)
- 3 eggs
- 3 tsp vanilla essence

Pour the filling into the cake tin and bake in the oven for 50-60 minutes. I usually start checking the cake at around 45 minutes to ensure it doesn't overbake.
